Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well.\n\nThe councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California's [[Brown Act]], which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies.\n\nThe first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18% increase in water rates by the city's [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|Department of Water and Power]]. This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review. More recently, some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action, but the City Council put off a decision.\n\nThe neighborhood councils have been allocated $45,000 each per year for administration, outreach and approved neighborhood projects.\n\n===Crime===\n{{See also|Crime in Los Angeles}}\n[[Image:May Day Immigration March LA66.jpg|thumb|The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] during May Day 2006 in front of the new Caltrans District 7 Headquarters]]\nLike [[Crime in the United States|most American cities]], Los Angeles has been experiencing significant decline in crime since the mid-1990s, and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/news/local/northeast-edition/80935317.html |agency=Wire services |title=Crime rate lowest in 50 years, LAPD says |newspaper=Los Angeles Wave |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}  Northeast Edition.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/read_the_beat_magazine/pdf_view/43819 |title=LAPD year-end crime statistics |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] is a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Members|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703052727/http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml|archivedate=July 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Los Angeles reported 314 homicides, which corresponds to a rate of 7.85 (per 100,000 population)\u2014a major decrease from 1993, when the all time homicide rate of over 21.1 (per 100,000 population) was reported for the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/cityprof.pdf |title=LAPD Online Crime Rates |format=PDF |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> This included 15 officer-involved shootings.
